## The Problem

TurboScribe is a GPU-accelerated audio transcription and meeting detection
application (~7,500 LOC across Python + C#/WPF). Its Python backend
(`fast_engine.py`) is a 1,520-line monolith handling 10 distinct modes:
VAD scanning, batch transcription, semantic search, meeting detection, LLM
analysis, and timestamp extraction.

When you ask an AI to modify this codebase, it faces a fundamental challenge:

| Approach | Tokens In | Risk |
|---|---:|---|
| Paste entire codebase | **~110,000** | Partition Function Z explodes — attention decays, model confabulates |
| Paste one file | **~16,000** | AI sees internal details of unrelated modes, confabulates cross-dependencies |
| Describe changes in English | **~500** | Semantic cross-talk: overloaded English words create shallow attractor basins |

Every approach leads to the same failure: **AI-generated code that silently
couples modules that were previously independent**, introducing regressions
that only surface at runtime.

## The SCP Solution

The Spatial Constraint Protocol (SCP) replaces "paste everything and hope"
with **orthogonal architectural contracts**. Instead of showing the AI
your code (flooding the Partition Function Z with distractor tokens), you show it:

1. **What this module does** (interface contract — orthogonal Uiua embedding)
2. **What it may depend on** (dependency list — interfaces only, not implementations)
3. **What it must never touch** (forbidden zones via RAG Denial)
4. **How each method behaves** (glyph semantics — Origin, Filter, Fold, Witness, Weaver)

The AI never sees any other module's implementation. It **cannot** confabulate
cross-module coupling because the coupling surfaces are simply not in context.
The orthogonal embeddings create steep, isolated attractor basins that pierce
through context noise.

## TurboScribe Decomposition

The monolithic `fast_engine.py` was decomposed into 9 isolated SCP modules:

**What this means in practice:**

- The AI sees **~660 orthogonal tokens** of precise contracts instead of **~110,000 noisy tokens**
  of raw code. This restores the Critical Energy Gap (ΔE > ln(N)) and leaves 99.4%
  of the context window free for reasoning.
- A 4K context window model can implement any single TurboScribe module —
  Z stays small enough for clean signal resolution.
- A 128K context window model never needs to page or truncate — it processes
  the entire module spec in one shot with massive room for chain-of-thought.

## How SCP Prevents Regressions

### 1. RAG Denial

When implementing the `Transcriber` module, the AI sees:

- ✅ Transcriber's own contract (methods, constraints, glyph rules)
- ✅ AudioIngest and VoiceDetector **interfaces** (what they return)
- ❌ AudioIngest implementation (how they load files)
- ❌ SearchEngine, MeetingDetector, Analyzer (everything downstream)
- ❌ TimestampExtractor (independent branch)

The AI **cannot** accidentally import `SearchEngine` internals into
`Transcriber` because `SearchEngine` doesn't exist in its context.
This keeps Z small and the orthogonal signal in a steep attractor basin.

### 2. Glyph Contracts

Each method is governed by a Chevron primitive that enforces behavioral rules:

| Glyph | Name | Rule | Violation Example |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| ◬ | Origin | Appears once per program, no nesting | Calling `load_model()` inside a loop |
| ☾ | Fold Time | Must have a reachable base case | Infinite recursion in `batch_transcribe()` |
| Ө | Filter | Pure gate — input passes or is rejected | `keyword_search()` modifying transcripts |
| 𓂀 | Witness | Observe-only — zero side effects | `emit_progress()` raising an exception |
| ☤ | Weaver | Braids multiple streams into one | `generate()` returning raw API response |

The AI cannot generate a `Transcriber.transcribe_file()` that also does
search, because the ☾ (Fold Time) glyph requires a pure fold operation
with a reachable base case — not a multi-purpose function.

### 3. Weaver Verification (System 2 Rejection Sampling)

After the AI generates code, the Weaver (☤) — acting as Maxwell's Demon —
performs AST-based rejection sampling:

- All declared methods are implemented
- No forbidden imports are present
- Glyph contracts are satisfied
- Dependency boundaries are respected
- MI_AST = 0 for all non-edge module pairs

A passing verification returns `W(G) = 0`, meaning zero undeclared coupling — the architecture is structurally orthogonal.

## How This Was Constructed

### Step 1: Analyze the Monolith

The original `fast_engine.py` was analyzed to identify natural boundaries:

```python
# 10 modes found in fast_engine.py:
#   mode 1: transcribe_file   → Transcriber
#   mode 2: batch_transcribe   → Transcriber
#   mode 3: transcribe_dir     → Transcriber
#   mode 4: vad_scan           → VoiceDetector
#   mode 5: batch_vad_scan     → VoiceDetector
#   mode 6: search             → SearchEngine
#   mode 7: semantic_search    → SearchEngine
#   mode 8: run_server         → (excluded — HTTP wrapper)
#   mode 9: analyze            → Analyzer
#   mode 10: detect_meetings   → MeetingDetector
```

Shared concerns were extracted:
- Audio loading → `AudioIngest`
- LLM calls → `LLMProvider`
- Progress output → `ProgressWitness`
- `timestamp_engine.py` → `TimestampExtractor`

### Step 2: Assign Glyphs

Each module's primary operation was mapped to a Chevron primitive:

- **Data entry points** (file discovery, model loading) → ◬ Origin
- **Batch/recursive operations** (transcription, timestamp extraction) → ☾ Fold Time
- **Pass/reject gates** (search, VAD, meeting detection) → Ө Filter
- **Pure observers** (progress logging) → 𓂀 Witness
- **Multi-stream combiners** (LLM + prompt → response) → ☤ Weaver

### Step 3: Define Contracts

For each module, we specified:
1. **Methods** — exact signatures with input/output types
2. **Glyph per method** — which primitive governs its behavior
3. **Constraints** — what the module must NOT do
4. **Dependencies** — which other modules' interfaces it may call

### Step 4: Generate & Verify

```bash
# Generate SCP prompt for any module
python examples/turboscribe_example.py Transcriber

# Generate + implement + verify with Gemini
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
python examples/turboscribe_example.py Transcriber --gemini
```

The Gemini output was verified by the Weaver: **PASS: W(G) = 0**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# See the full architecture
python examples/turboscribe_example.py

# Generate a module prompt (copy into any AI chat)
python examples/turboscribe_example.py AudioIngest

# End-to-end with Gemini
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
python examples/turboscribe_example.py Transcriber --gemini
```

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI code generation asks the model to understand your **entire
codebase** before making a change. This causes the Partition Function (Z)
to explode — attention probability mass dilutes, and the model confabulates
by relaxing into pre-trained priors.

SCP flips this: the AI sees **only the operating table** — the one module it
needs to implement, encoded with orthogonal Uiua embeddings that create steep
attractor basins free of semantic cross-talk. The Weaver (System 2 rejection
sampling) verifies structural orthogonality. The result is code that fits into
the existing architecture by construction, not by coincidence.

For TurboScribe, this means:
- **18× less context** for the full architecture spec (Z reduced dramatically)
- **166× less context** per individual module (ΔE restored above ln(N))
- **Zero coupling violations** verified by the Weaver (W(G) = 0)
- **Any AI model** (even 4K context) can implement a single module correctly
